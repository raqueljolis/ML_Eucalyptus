## Introduction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the species of Eucalyptus plants, which is crucial for research, conservation, and a deeper understanding of each plant. We implemented several methods, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

## Dataset Description
We selected the 'Eucalyptus' dataset from the OpenML website. The dataset includes numerical and categorical variables. It encompasses several species of Eucalyptus, featuring various attributes that can potentially distinguish one species from another.

### Original Dataset Characteristics:
- **Sample Size:** 736
- **Features:** 20
- **Missing Values:** 448 missing values across 95 samples
- **Target:** Species
- **Number of Species:** 25

## Data Exploration and Pre-processing
We addressed issues with data representation, missing values, outliers, and converted categorical variables for model compatibility. Additionally, we handled class imbalances to improve model performance.

### Steps:
1. **Feature Selection:** Simplified the model by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features.
2. **Target Representation Threshold:** Focused on target classes with more than 10 samples.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and outliers, and scaled numerical data.
4. **Final Pre-processed Dataset Characteristics:**
   - **Final Sample Size:** 663
   - **Features:** 16
   - **Target:** Species
   - **Number of Species:** 17

## Modeling
We implemented and compared various machine learning models focusing and classses with more than 10 samples and we tried as well grouping classes with fewer than 10 samples into a single category. 
1. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Achieved an F1 macro score of 0.329.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):** Best hyperparameters were 3 neighbors, Manhattan distance, and distance weights, achieving an F1 macro score of 0.284.
3. **Random Forest:** The best implementation achieved an F1 macro score of 0.520 with optimized hyperparameters.
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Best hyperparameters achieved an F1 macro score of 0.367.

## Results and Discussion
The Random Forest model with optimized hyperparameters performed the best among all the models. Grouping classes with fewer than 10 samples into a single category did not lead to overall performance improvements.

## Conclusions
The Random Forest model proved to be the most effective for our dataset, handling class imbalances and achieving the highest F1 macro score. Despite the dataset's limitations, the model was configured to optimally handle potential difficulties, ensuring high-quality performance. Future improvements could include collecting more data and exploring different clustering strategies for similar species.
